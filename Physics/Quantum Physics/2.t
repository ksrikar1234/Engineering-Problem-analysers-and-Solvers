Mechanical energy storage systems for large scale applications

Abstract ( What's our project about )

Energy requirements are increasing faster than ever. Although renewable energy sources are showing a great promise , In order to store energy at large scale and the uneven we need reliable and economically viable implementations.

This project aims to propose a novel solution of using mechanical batteries to store energy

Background research

(What has been already done ??)

Currently mechanical batteries are used for intermediate energy storage and accumulation purposes. Although there are implementations for primary storage purpose, they were unable deploy due to physical and design constraints.

Existing implementations

1. Gravitational potential batteries

2. Flywheel batteries

3. Steain energy storage systems

4. Pressure energy storage systems

What we want to do ?

Our goal is to model a working prototype of a gravitational potential battery combined with spring energy if design parameters permits.

Abstract Model Components :

1.  Energy storage element

2. Energy transducer

3. Energy pathways

1. Energy storage Element.

        Stores energy in gravitational potential energy.

        Device : weighted cylinder

2. Energy conversion mechanism

         Converts mechanical energy into electrical energy.

         Device : Dynamo

        

3. Energy intermediate pathways

            Converts raw potential energy to usable mechanical energy

          Device : Roller mechanism , Gears
